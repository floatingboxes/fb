      <h2>Pear Deck Identity</h2>
      <p>The number one question I get about Pear Deck is &#8220;Why the Pear?&#8221; The answer is that we wanted to create a unique brand in the K-12 education space filled with people who use words like <em>assessment</em>, <em>differentiation</em>, <em>twenty-first century skills</em>, and <em>PowerPoint</em>.</p>
      <p>Pears are sweet, fun, and good for you. The brand strives to represent the mentality we hope to promote in K-12 classrooms.</p>

      <h2>Pear Deck Website</h2>
      <p>This latest iteration of the Pear Deck website is designed to capitalize on what our users want to do (try the product) while driving them quickly to Pear Deck's "Ah-ha!" moment (seeing students join and respond in a presentation).</p>
      <p>The website is a constantly evolving project, as we react not only to incoming data but advances in our product and sales process. Feel free to <a href="http://www.peardeck.com">explore the entire site here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Pear Deck Videos</h2>
      <p>We use video at Pear Deck to communicate a range of topics, from basic introductions to complex use cases of the app. For our most important videos I spend time coordinating voice talent, creating motion graphics, and editing the final result.</p>

      <h2>Pear Deck Web App</h2>
      <p>Design and front-end development on the Pear Deck Web App is how I like to spend most of my time. From initial sketches, to interactive prototype building, to user testing, to working with the product team on maintainable markup and styling, I'm involved in every step.</p>
      <p>Pear Deck is free for 30 days, <a href="#">create an account</a> and test drive it yourself.</p>

      <h2>Pear Deck Investor Packet</h2>
      <p>For a startup, communicating effectively with investors can be as important as communicating with customers. I helped develop and design this 20 page booklet to deliver our pitch in a beautiful manner. The information within the packet is primarily confidential, but I'd be happy to share a redacted document in person.</p>

      <h2>Pear Deck Email Marketing</h2>
      <p>Designing a building an effective automated follow-up email campaign is a necessary evil for effective web app marketing. You know what I mean by "evil" if you've ever tried coding even complex HTML emails.</p>
      <p>I developed an automated build process to make the process less painful when new emails and email templates are needed.</p>
