# Floatingboxes.com

My very simple personal website, which you can find at [floatingboxes.com](http://floatingboxes.com).

### Lotta crap for a simple website, pal...

Yeah, yeah.

 - The `ruby-*` and `Gemfile` business lets you use rvm/bundler to install the appropriate versions of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
 - The `package.json` lets you `npm install` all of the nice bits like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer).

So to get started first run `bundle install` then `npm install` then `grunt dev` to work locally.
